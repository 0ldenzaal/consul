        recommendation_one: Do not write the topic title or whole sentences in capital letters. On the internet that is considered shouting. And no one likes to be yelled at.
        recommendation_two: Any topic or comment that implies an illegal action will be eliminated, also those that intend to sabotage the spaces of the subject, everything else is allowed.
        recommendation_three: Enjoy this space, the voices that fill it, it's yours too
        without_topics: Create the first community topic
